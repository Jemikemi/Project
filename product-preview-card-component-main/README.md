## My process
I built the desktop view first and used media query to do the mobile view.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt to use media queries
```css
@media (max-width:400px) {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Continued development

i am still finding it hard to use flexbox. I hipe to get better as i do more frontend projects.
