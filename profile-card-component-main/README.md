## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

i learnt to use the background-position css property and how to use two background images as a background.

```css
body{
    background-color: var(--Darkcyan);
    background-image: url("images/bg-pattern-top.svg"), url("images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg");
    background-position: bottom 45vh right 45vw, top 45vh left 45vw;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```


### Continued development

The position css property is a bit tricky to me, i would like to keep working on it.

## Acknowledgments

I woud like to appreciate @motuncoded. I used her work as a reference to understand how to manipulate the background.
